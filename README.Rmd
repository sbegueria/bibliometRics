# bibliometRics [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/57246514.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/57246514)

Santiago Beguería  
26 April 2016

`bibliometRics` is an R package for bibliometric analysis of scientific
production. It can be used for analysing the production of a single
author, a working team, department, institute, etcetera.

This document describes the main functionalities in the package, and how
to do a bibliometric analysis with `bibliometRics`, including producing
automatic pdf reports via `knitr`.

You can cite this package on your work as: **Beguería S. (2015)
bibliometRics: an R package for for bibliometric analysis of scientific
production, <doi:10.5281/zenodo.834260>**.

## Installation

You can install this version of GitHub (note that this is a working
project):

``` r
devtools::install_github("sbegueria/bibliometRics")
```

## Getting some bibliometric data

So far the unique source of blibiometric information accepted by
`bibliometRics` is the Web of Science (WoS) by Thomson Reuters, but
other sources such as Scopus or Google Scholar can be added in the
future. Publications can be selected for a given author (easiest if you
know its author ID) or a group (such a research group or a department,
for instance). The WoS allows to generate a citation report, stating the
number of citations received by each item, every year after its
publication. So once you are good with the selection of publications you
want to analyze, you can click on the ‘create citation report’ button
and then select the ‘save to text file’ option. This will generate a
text file and download it to your computer. You may want to edit the
AUTHOR field on the first line of this text file, although this is not
strictly necessary for doing the analysis.

An example citation report file from the WoS is the file
[sbegueria.txt](sbegueria.txt), which contains data of papers I have
authored, as of January 2017.

The core function for reading WoS citation report data is, not
surprisingly, `read.wos`. Its only argument is the name of the data file
you want to read:

``` r
bib <- read.wos('sbegueria.txt')
str(bib)
```

``` r

The result is a list with the following three elements: \* `author`, a
character object with the name of the author being analysed; \*
`reference`, a character object; and \* `pubs`, a data frame with the
publications in rows, and the data referring to each publications in
columns, including the number of citations received, year by year.

## Analyzing bibliometric data

The main function for analyizing these data is `bibliometric`. It takes
an object with the bibliometric data resulting from a call to `read.wos`
and returns a data.frame with a number of bibliometric indices.

In order to compute some metrics which are based on the number of
citations received by each publication, data on the percentile baselines
for each scientific discipline is requireed. This data can be found on
another Thomson Reuters product, the ‘Essential Science Indicators’
database. You need to navigate to the ‘Field Baselines’ tab, and then
select ‘Percentiles’ to get the field percentile baselines (FPB). You
can then download the FPB table in csv format.

An example FPB table as of January 2017 can be found in file
[BaselinePercentiles.csv](BaselinePercentiles.csv). This table can be
read with the function ‘read.baselines’:

``` r
base <- read.baselines('BaselinePercentiles.csv')
```

The resulting object is a list with as many items as disciplines. For
each discipline, a data.frame is stored containing the threshold number
of citations corresponding to each percentile, depending on the
publication year. For instance, this is are the baseline thresholds for
the discipline ‘Geosciences’:

``` r
base$GEOSCIENCES
```

We can now use the function `bibliometric`, especifying the, the field
baselines, and the discipline (the table for ‘all fields’ will be used
as a default if no discipline is specified).

``` r
bibliometric(bib, base, 'GEOSCIENCES')
```

``` r

There are functions for computing some of the indices, such as the
Hirsch and the Egghe indices. These can be computed for the whole period
analyized, or up to a given year.

``` r
hirsch(bib)
```

``` r
##  [1] 33
```

``` r
egghe(bib)
```

``` r
##  [1] 57
```

``` r
hirsch(bib, 2010)
```

``` r
##  [1] 13
```

``` r
egghe(bib, 2010)
```

``` r
##  [1] 45
```

There is also a function for ranking the publications in quantiles:

``` r
rank(bib, q=base$GEOSCIENCES)
```

``` r
##   [1] >q0     >q0     >q0     >q0     >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.99  >q0    
##   [9] >q0.8   >q0.8   >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.99  >q0.99  >q0.99  >q0.999
##  [17] >q0     >q0.99  >q0.99  >q0.5   >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.999 >q0    
##  [25] >q0     >q0.5   >q0.5   >q0.8   >q0.8   >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.9  
##  [33] >q0     >q0     >q0.5   >q0.5   >q0.8   >q0.8   >q0.8   >q0.8  
##  [41] >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.99  >q0     >q0     >q0.5   >q0.8   >q0.9  
##  [49] >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.99  >q0.999 >q0.5   >q0.5

##  [73] >q0.8   >q0.9   >q0.9   >q0.9   <NA>    <NA>    <NA>    <NA>   
##  [81] <NA>    <NA>    <NA>    <NA>    <NA>    <NA>    <NA>    <NA>   
##  Levels: >q0.9999 >q0.999 >q0.99 >q0.9 >q0.8 >q0.5 >q0
```

``` r
table(rank(bib, q=base$GEOSCIENCES))
```

``` r
##  >q0.9999  >q0.999   >q0.99    >q0.9    >q0.8    >q0.5      >q0 
##         0        3        8       21       20       11       13 
```

A specific plotting function makes it easy to resume most of this
information in graphic form. The plots also inform about the temporal
evolution of the bibliometric indices, which may be useful for
evaluating the scientific career of the
evaluated.

```{r, fig.cap="A graphic bibliometric analysis"}
library(bibliometRics)
wos_file = system.file("sbegueria.txt", package = "bibliometRics")
bib <- read.wos(wos_file)
base <- read.baselines()
biblioplot(bib, quant = base$GEOSCIENCES)
```

The first plot reflects the productivity (quantity) of the author, as
well as its impact (citations received). It shows the cumulative number
of publications, with distinction between the publications as lead
author (black bars) and those as co-author (white bars). The plot also
showcases the number of citations for all the publications (white
circles) and for those as lead author (black circles). There is a fixed
ratio of 1:10 between the left (publications) and the right (citations)
axis, allowing for easy comparison across authors, groups, etc. This
ratio implies assuming a mean citation rate of 10 citations per article
publishes (a rate that is, of course, arbitrary).

The second plot focuses on the impact of the publications. It shows the
annual evolution of the Hirsch’s h-index (white circles) and the Egghe’s
g-index (black circles), with a fixed ratio of 1:2 between them.
Evolution of the h-index is compared with an 1:1 evolution (dashed
line), since it is usually assumed that the h-index grows, as an
average, at a rate of 1 per year.

The third plot attempts at evaluating the excelence of the publications.
It shows the number of publications classified by quantiles, according
to the ISI-WoK Scientific Indicators per discipline. For each quantile,
the total number of publications is shown (white bars), as well as the
publications as lead author (black bars).

A formatted list of all the publications is also
produced.

``` r
format_pub(cbind(bib$pubs, rank(bib,q=base$GEOSCIENCES))[1,], au=bib$au)
```

``` r
##  [1] "\\item Quijano, Laura;\\textbf{ Begueria, Santiago}; Gaspar, Leticia; Navas, Ana. Estimating Erosion Rates using Cs-137 Measurements and Watem/Sedem in a Mediterranean Cultivated Field. \\textit{CATENA} 138: 38--51. 2016. (cit: 0; $7$)\n"
```

## Automated bibliometric reports

The package also contains a template `bibliometRics.Rtex` file, useful
for creating automated reports. You’ll need to load the package `knitr`
in order to produce the report.

``` r
require(knitr)
```

``` r
infile <- 'sbegueria.txt'
outfile <- 'sbegueria.Rtex'

# Create custom .Rtex file from the template and knit it
x <- readLines('bibliometRics.Rtex')
x <- gsub('FILENAME',infile,x)
write(x,outfile)
knit(outfile)

# Compile the resulting .tex file and create a .pdf from it
system(paste('/Library/TeX/texbin/pdflatex ',
    gsub('.txt','',infile),'.tex',sep=''))

# Remove unnecesary intermediate files
kk <- list.files('.',paste(gsub('.txt','', infile)))
file.remove(kk[-c(grep('.pdf',kk),grep('.txt',kk))])
```

An example report generated by the above code chunk can be found in the
file [sbegueria.pdf]('./sbegueria.pdf').
